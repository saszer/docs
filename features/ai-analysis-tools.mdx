</Info>

<Card title="Smart Filters Integration" icon="filter" href="/features/smart-filters" horizontal>
Learn how to use Smart Filters to control which transactions get analyzed by AI tools.
</Card>

## 1. Smart Categorize

AI-powered bulk categorization that automatically assigns categories to multiple transactions based on machine learning analysis.

### How Smart Categorize Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply Filters (Optional)">
    Use Smart Filters to narrow down transactions you want to categorize. Common filters:
    - "This Month" + "Uncategorized"
    - Date range + "Needs Analysis"
    - Specific amount range
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Smart Categorize">
    Click the "Smart Categorize" button at the top of the page. The system fetches all filtered transactions for analysis.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI Processing">
    AI analyzes each transaction's description, merchant, and historical patterns to suggest appropriate categories with confidence scores.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Suggestions">
    Modal opens showing all AI-suggested categories. Review suggestions, modify as needed, or skip transactions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Apply Categories">
    Click "Apply Categories" to save all categorizations. The system updates transactions and refreshes the table automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### AI Analysis Process

<AccordionGroup>

    - Review all suggestions before applying
    - Correct low-confidence matches manually
    - Accept high-confidence matches quickly
    - Run regularly (weekly or monthly)
    
    **Workflow Optimization:**

    - Combine with date filters for period-based processing
    - Process by transaction type (expenses, then income)
    - Sort by amount to prioritize large transactions
    - Review merchant patterns for consistency
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Common Scenarios">
    **Scenario 1: After CSV Import**
    - Filter: Newest Data Bucket + Uncategorized

    **Incorrect Suggestions:**
    - **Cause**: Similar merchant names, ambiguous descriptions
    - **Solution**: Provide correct category, pattern recognized
    
    **Inconsistent Categories:**
    - **Cause**: Multiple similar categories, unclear hierarchy
    - **Solution**: Consolidate categories, use clear naming
    
    **Slow Processing:**
    - **Cause**: Large transaction sets, complex filters
    - **Solution**: Use date filters to limit scope, process in batches
