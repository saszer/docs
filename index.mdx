## GST & Receipt Automation

AI2Fin operates as global GST compliance software with digital receipt management built in. Your tax preferences drive every calculation:

- Localised GST/VAT rates auto-fill `gstIncluded`, `gstRateUsed`, `gstAmount`, and base amounts for every expense and bill.
- Receipt tracking dashboards flag missing attachments, surface audit trails, and highlight recurring bill occurrences that need documentation.
- Mobile photo capture, PDF invoice uploads, and chat-driven receipt intake ensure every transaction is backed by an attachment before export.

This end-to-end automation keeps deductions compliant while reducing manual bookkeeping time.
