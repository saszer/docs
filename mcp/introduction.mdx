# Connect AI Assistants to Your Financial Data

**MCP Server URL:**
```
https://api.ai2fin.com/mcp/inspector
```

Use AI2Fin's **Finance MCP Server** to connect ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI assistants directly to your financial data. Ask questions about your expenses, get tax deduction insights, track bills, and analyze spending—all through natural conversation with your AI assistant.

## What Can You Do?

With AI2Fin's finance MCP server, you can:

- **Ask about tax deductions:** "What expenses are tax deductible this year?"
- **Track spending:** "Show me my spending by category this month"
- **Manage bills:** "What bills are due this week?"
- **Analyze expenses:** "Where do I spend the most money?"
- **Process receipts:** "Upload this receipt and categorize it"
- **Get financial insights:** "What's my financial outlook for next month?"

Your AI assistant accesses your financial data securely and answers your questions instantly using **65+ financial tools** for expense tracking, tax deduction analysis, bill management, and financial reporting.

## How It Works

### Connect ChatGPT via OpenAI Apps SDK

Connect your ChatGPT to AI2Fin using OpenAI's Apps SDK. Once connected, you can ask ChatGPT questions about your finances:

**Example Conversation:**
```
You: "What are my tax deductible expenses this year?"
ChatGPT: "You have $12,450 in tax deductible expenses across 8 categories. 
         Your top deduction categories are:
         - Office Supplies: $3,245
         - Travel: $2,187
         - Professional Services: $1,890
         ..."
```

ChatGPT uses AI2Fin's MCP server to access your financial data and provide accurate, real-time answers about your expenses, bills, and tax deductions.

### Use with Other AI Assistants

You can also use AI2Fin's finance MCP server with:
- **Claude** - Connect via API for financial analysis
- **Custom AI Agents** - Build your own financial assistant
- **Automation Tools** - Automate financial workflows and reporting

Want to connect AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor) to search and reference AI2Fin's documentation? Use the following MCP URL to enable AI-powered documentation search:

**MCP Documentation URL:**
```
https://docs.ai2fin.com/mcp
```

### How to Connect

1. **In your AI application** (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.), add a new MCP server connection
2. **Use the URL:** `https://docs.ai2fin.com/mcp`
3. **Authenticate** using your API key (same as for the financial data MCP server)
4. **Start searching** - Your AI assistant can now search across all AI2Fin documentation

### Available Documentation Tools

Once connected, your AI assistant will have access to:

- **SearchAi2FinDocumentation** - Search across the AI2Fin Documentation knowledge base to find relevant information, code examples, API references, and guides. Use this tool when you need to answer questions about AI2Fin Documentation, find specific documentation, understand how features work, or locate implementation details. The search returns contextual content with titles and direct links to the documentation pages.

### Use Cases

- **Find API examples** - "Show me how to authenticate with the MCP server"
- **Understand features** - "How does smart categorization work?"
- **Get code samples** - "Give me an example of creating a transaction via API"
- **Troubleshoot issues** - "What are common authentication errors?"

<Tip>
The documentation MCP server is separate from the financial data MCP server. Use `https://docs.ai2fin.com/mcp` for documentation search, and `https://api.ai2fin.com/mcp` for accessing your financial data.
