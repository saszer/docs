### Integration Use Cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ChatGPT Integration">
    **Use Case:** Connect ChatGPT to your financial data
    
    **How It Works:**
    1. Authenticate via OAuth in ChatGPT Apps SDK
    2. ChatGPT can now answer questions about your finances
    3. All data access is user-isolated and secure
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    User: "What are my tax deductible expenses this year?"
    ChatGPT: [Calls get_tax_deductible_summary via MCP]
    ChatGPT: "You have $12,450 in tax deductible expenses across 8 categories..."
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Custom Financial AI Agent">
    **Use Case:** Build a custom AI assistant for your business
    
    **How It Works:**
    1. Generate API key via admin endpoint
    2. Use API key to authenticate MCP requests
    3. Build custom workflows and integrations
    
    **Example:**
    ```python
    # Custom expense approval bot
    expenses = mcp.get_transactions(isTaxDeductible=True)
    for expense in expenses:
        if expense.amount > 1000:
            send_approval_request(expense)
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Automated Financial Workflows">
    **Use Case:** Automate recurring financial tasks
    
    **How It Works:**
    1. Use MCP tools to query data
    2. Apply business logic
    3. Create/update transactions, bills, categories
    
    **Example:**
    ```python
    # Weekly spending report automation
    weekly_summary = mcp.get_category_spending_summary(
        startDate="2024-01-01",
        endDate="2024-01-07"
    )
    send_email_report(weekly_summary)
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Receipt Processing Automation">
    **Use Case:** Automatically process receipts from email or uploads
    
    **How It Works:**
    1. Receive receipt image
    2. Call `analyze_receipt` to extract data
    3. Call `commit_receipt` to create transaction
    4. Automatic categorization via custom rules
    
    **Example:**
    ```python
    # Email receipt processor
    receipt_data = mcp.analyze_receipt(image_url)
    transaction = mcp.commit_receipt(
        receiptUrl=image_url,
        merchant=receipt_data.merchant,
        amount=receipt_data.total
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authentication

AI2Fin MCP supports two authentication methods:

- **OAuth (JWT)** - For `/mcp` endpoint (ChatGPT Apps SDK)
- **API Key** - For `/mcp/inspector` endpoint (MCP Inspector, custom integrations)

<Warning>
All MCP requests require authentication. User data is strictly isolated per authenticated user or API key.
</Warning>

## Common Issues & Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Errors" icon="key">
    **Issue:** "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid token"
    
    **Solutions:**
    - ✅ Ensure token is included in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
    - ✅ Check token hasn't expired (JWT tokens expire after set duration)
    - ✅ For API keys, verify key hasn't been revoked
    - ✅ Regenerate token/API key if needed
    
    **Prevention:**
    - Implement token refresh logic
    - Store tokens securely (environment variables, secret management)
    - Monitor token expiration times
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Exceeded" icon="gauge">
    **Issue:** "429 Too Many Requests"
    
    **Solutions:**
    - ✅ Wait for rate limit window to reset (15 minutes)
    - ✅ Implement exponential backoff retry logic
    - ✅ Use batch operations instead of individual calls
    - ✅ Upgrade to higher tier for increased limits
    
    **Rate Limits:**
    - `/mcp` (OAuth): 200 requests per 15 minutes per user
    - `/mcp/inspector` (API Key): 50 requests per 15 minutes per key
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tool Execution Timeout" icon="clock">
    **Issue:** Request times out after 20 seconds
    
    **Solutions:**
    - ✅ Use summary tools instead of fetching all transactions
    - ✅ Add date filters to limit data scope
    - ✅ Use pagination for large datasets
    - ✅ Check network connectivity
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Use `get_category_spending_summary` instead of `get_transactions` for summaries
    - Use `get_tax_deductible_summary` instead of filtering all transactions
    - Add `limit` parameter to queries
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Not Found" icon="search">
    **Issue:** "No transactions found" or empty results
    
    **Solutions:**
    - ✅ Check date range filters (transactions may be outside range)
    - ✅ Verify user has data in the system
    - ✅ Check category/merchant filters aren't too restrictive
    - ✅ Ensure user authentication is correct (data is user-isolated)
    
    **Debugging:**
    - Start with broad queries (no filters)
    - Gradually add filters to narrow results
    - Use `get_transactions` with minimal filters first
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Write Operation Requires Confirmation" icon="lock">
    **Issue:** Write operations return "needsConfirmation: true"
    
    **Solutions:**
    - ✅ This is expected behavior for write/destructive operations
    - ✅ First call returns `confirmToken`
    - ✅ Second call with `confirmToken` executes the operation
    - ✅ This prevents accidental data modifications
    
    **Example:**
    ```json
    // First call
    {"needsConfirmation": true, "confirmToken": "confirm_abc123..."}
    
    // Second call with token
    {"confirmToken": "confirm_abc123...", ...other params}
    ```
  </Accordion>
