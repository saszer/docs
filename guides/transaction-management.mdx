## FAQs

### How can I quickly find transactions missing receipts?
Use the receipt status filter (has receipt vs missing) or ask the AI assistant to list transactions without attachments. Both options respect your current filters and permissions.

### What is the fastest way to update GST amounts in bulk?
Select the relevant transactions, open the GST bulk editor, or run a chat command such as “Update GST for my March Uber rides” to trigger the bulk tools.

### Can I manage recurring bills from the All Transactions page?
Yes. When AI2Fin detects a recurring pattern, linked transactions show pattern indicators, and you can jump into bill occurrences or link receipts directly from the table.
